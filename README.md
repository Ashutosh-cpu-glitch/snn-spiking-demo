# ðŸ§  Neuromorphic Spike-Based Simulation using Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron

This repository presents a scientific, interpretable implementation of a **spiking neural network (SNN)** using the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** neuron model. The project simulates biologically inspired neuron dynamics and spike-based decision-making using Python and Jupyter Notebook, offering an educational and research-aligned introduction to **neuromorphic computing**.

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

Neuromorphic computing seeks to mimic the brain's event-driven architecture using spiking neuron models that communicate via discrete action potentials (spikes). Unlike conventional neural networks, SNNs encode information temporally, enabling asynchronous and low-power computation.

This project demonstrates the temporal dynamics of a single LIF neuron receiving input from synthetic stimuli. The goal is to model how such neurons integrate inputs, leak membrane potential over time, and emit spikes when a threshold is exceeded â€” a fundamental process in biological neural systems.
